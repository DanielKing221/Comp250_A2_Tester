# Comp250_A2_Tester
This a tester created for the various methods on Assignment 2 of COMP 250 - Fall 22. I used the same format as in the prof's minitester. This contains testers for methods and edge cases not included in the minitester. 

So far it has testers for: 
  tripleCut()
  countCut()
  locateJoker()    // edge case if the deck is empty
